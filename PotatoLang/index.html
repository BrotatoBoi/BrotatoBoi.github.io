                    One day, I thought "Hey! I want to make a simple, multi-purpose programming language."
                    So I did some researching and found out it was really complicated looking and I got scared and gave up.
                    Later, it seemed like a much more simple idea (After more learning and practicing) and I decided to make it.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Using python as my base language, I made it run as a program. It then takes in commands.
                    Here you would use <code>run [FILE]</code> to run a <var>.pot</var> file (Which is the extension for PotatoLang files).
                    Then it starts going through the file and reads each line, then processes it based on the first found block of characters.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    You can find the documentation <a href="./documentation.html">here</a>
