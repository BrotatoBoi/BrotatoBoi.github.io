        <h1>The Game of Life!</h1>

        <p>
            Here I have made a recreation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Conway's Game of Life.</a>
            It doesn't work exactly like it, but it is similar!
            
            <br>

            To play, just press that button to start the simulation!
