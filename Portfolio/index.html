                Hello my name is Aaron Cassell and I am a self taught programmer!

                <br>
                
                I have been programming since I was 14, I first started in JavaScript 
                making Minecraft PE mods. I watched YouTube videos and read tutorials
                on how to add custom items and I found it fun! After a while of making
                silly mods, I found out JavaScript can be used in websites and learned
                HTML and CSS to make a website - Not this one, a lot of my earlier work
                has been purged or just not saved. I wanted to try and make my own games
                and found out about C++, I learned a decent amount of it but I didn't do
                much with it because around that time I found Python, which I feel is better
                for both readability and functionality.
